## AWS :

### AMAZON S3 (simple storage service):
* Block level of storage 
* It is highly scalable , secuarable , durable
* Easy to store and retrive the data
* Object based storage and data is spread miltple regions.
* for S3 we dont need server , becauz here storage we are not doing in server , we are doing storage in specific resources thats called (bucket) , we r storing our data in buckets
* for ex : i want to store the 10 Md of data , so for that i have created bucket. and i store this 10 MD od data , so we can access this data at anytime & anywhere 
* And bucket is Globally accesible
* Max size : 5TB , Min  size : 1Kb for the bucket
* We only store in 5Gb of data in object 

### Buckets :
* If we create a root level folder then it is called as buckets
* Used ot store objects 
* we cannot delete the bucket directly , we need to make empty it first

### Object :
* files that we stored in a bucket called object
* When you put an object in bucket :
1. Key : Name of an object
2. Value : Data in bytes
3. VersionID : shows versioning

## Rules :
* Unique name
* Name should be 3 to 63 characters
* Only lowert case is valid
* Should not be in IP format
